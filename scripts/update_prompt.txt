Execute /update command for Personal Work Intelligence System.

## Instructions

Run delta update processing only new/changed items:

### Phase 1: Load Cursors
Read sync cursors from memory for each data source.

### Phase 2: Incremental Fetch
Fetch only items newer than cursor from each source.

### Phase 3: Delta Graph Update
Update graph with new items only, run entity-reconciliation on new entities (auto-merge threshold: 0.85).

### Phase 4: Quick Enrichment
Run inference-engine on new nodes only.

### Phase 5: Core Analysis
Run stale-detection (check decay), reply-suggestion (pending only), blocker-identification (new blockers) in parallel.

### Phase 6: Sentiment Check
Run sentiment-analysis on new messages only.

### Phase 7: Action Extraction
Run action-item-extraction on new items.

### Phase 8: Notify
Send notifications for critical items with confidence >= 0.7 (max 3 notifications).

## Required Skills

@import ../.claude/commands/update.md

## Confidence Handling

- Skip findings with confidence < 0.5 (log for later review)
- Auto-apply when confidence >= 0.8
- For confidence 0.5-0.8, apply and log

## Delta Threshold

If delta > 500 items, recommend switching to full-process.

## Output Format

Return JSON with:
- command: "update"
- type: "delta"
- started_at, completed_at timestamps
- delta: counts of new items by type
- graph_updates: nodes_added, edges_inferred, duplicates_merged
- analysis: findings from each skill
- cursors_updated: true/false
- low_confidence_skipped: count

## Efficiency

- Skip sources with no changes
- Timeout after 2 minutes
- If delta > 500 items, suggest full-process instead
